sought
to
bring
increased
data
analysis
to
insurance
underwriting,
a
strategy
that
AIG
Chief
Executive
Officer
Peter
Hancock
has
emphasized
at
his
company.
Two

will
also
help
AIG
with
the
venture’s
investment
portfolio.
Siegel,

“This
partnership
brings
tremendous
scale,
the
ability
to
provide
a
more
convenient
and
systematic
insurance
experience
for
small
businesses,
and
an
opportunity
for
us
to
address
the
challenge
of
optimal
insurance
asset
allocation,”
Siegel
said
in
the
statement.
Duperreault
will
be
the

and
Richard
Friesenhahn,
the
executive
vice

will
be
CEO.
The
companies
said
the

is
a

industry.
Charles
Sebaski,
an

said
Tuesday
in
a
note
to
clients
that
he
would
have
expected
AIG
to
already
have
the
sufficient
technology
resources
in
house.
“This
joint
venture
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
AIG’s
current
capabilities
and
recent
investments
in
data
analytics
have
not
yielded
the
results
necessary
for
the
company
to
utilize
technology
within
the
large

market
independently,”

Last
year,
while
the
average
hedge
fund
was
losing
money
and
several
prominent
hedge
funds
were
getting
clobbered
by
the
markets,
David
Siegel
got
on
a
stage
at
a
conference
attended
by
investment
professionals
and
declared
that
“eventually
the
time
will
come
that
no
human
investment
manager
will
be
able
to
beat
the
computer.”
A
computer
scientist
by
training,
Siegel
is
the
co-founder
of
Two
Sigma
Investments,
a
data-driven
New
York
hedge
fund
firm
using
mathematical
formulas
and
computer
algorithims
that
has
made
him
a
billionaire.
Two
Sigma
had
a
pretty
good
year
in
2015.
While
most
big
hedge
fund
firms
were
shrinking
in
size,
Two
Sigma’s
assets
under
management
rocketed
higher
in
2015
to
$32
billion
from
about
$24
billion
at
the
end
of
2014.
The
firm’s
hedge
funds
performed
well,
too.
For
example,
Two
Sigma’s
Compass
fund
and
its
Absolute
Return
Fund
both
returned
15%
net
of
fees
in
2015.

It
wasn’t
long
ago
that
quantitative
hedge
funds
seemed
to
be
losing
their
luster.
They
were
jolted
by
the
2007
quant
fund
meltdown
and
some
of
their
ambitious
expansion
plans
didn’t
work
out.
Jim
Simons,
the
most
famous
billionaire
quant
hedge
fund
manager,
retired
in
2011
as
chief
executive
of
Renaissance
Technologies,
the
firm
he
built.
Some
prominent
quant
funds
had
ho-hum
years
after
the
financial
crisis
and
the
financial
media
became
much
more
focused
on
hedge
fund
managers
pursuing
other
kinds
of
strategies
like
activism.
But
the
big
quant
funds
have
been
doing
very
well
and
in
a
sea
of
hedge
fund
disappointment
last
year,
the
most
prominent
quantitative
hedge
funds
stood
out.
Pete
Muller’s
statistical
arbitrage
PDT
Partners
Fund
returned
21.5%
net
of
fees
of
in
the
first
11
months
of
2015.
Muller’s
PDT
Partners
hedge
fund
firm
is
now
managing
some
$4.5
billion
three
years
after
it
was
spun
out
from
Morgan
Stanley
MS
+6.02%.
It
has
become
another
major
quant
force
in
the
hedge
fund
universe.
DE
Shaw
is
a
$39
billion
pioneering
quantitative
hedge
fund
that
has
been
around
since
billionaire
David
Shaw
founded
it
in
1988.
Its
big
Oculus
fund
reportedly
returned
10.2%
net
of
fees
in
the
first
11
months
of
2015.

Renaissance
Technologies,
the
$27
billion
quant
hedge
fund
firm
founded
by
Simons,
also
did
well
last
year.
One
of
the
funds
it
manages
for
outside
investors,
Renaissance
Institutional
Equities,
returned
17%
net
of
fees
in
2015.
Its
Renaissance
Institutional
Diversified
Alpha
fund
returned
16%
net
of
fees
last
year.
It
seems
like
in
2015
most
human
investment
managers–including
big
names
like
Buffett,
Icahn,
Einhorn
and
Ackman–were
not
able
to
beat
the
computer.
Two
Sigma
Investments,
the
Manhattan-based
quantitative
hedge
fund
that
manages
$24
billion,
sued
a
former
vice
president
on
Thursday
who
had
been
working
to
start
his
own
hedge
fund
firm.
Two
Sigma
claims
that
Sergey
Fein,
34,
a
former
Two
Sigma
quantitative
software
engineer
and
research
analyst,
breached
his
non-disclosure
and
non-compete
agreement
by
forming
a
new
hedge
fund
firm,
Phelps
Gate
Capital
Management,
in
October
2014.
According
to
the
17-page
complaint
filed
in
Manhattan’s
New
York
state
court,
Fein
organized
his
new
hedge
fund
“not
even
halfway
through
Fein’s
non-compete
period.”
Two
Sigma
is
seeking
to
get
a
New
York
state
judge
to
extend
the
period
of
Fein’s
non-compete
obligations,
which
was
slated
to
end
in
May,
for
an
amount
of
time
that
would
be
equal
to
the
amount
of
time
Two
Sigma
claims
Fein
breached
them.
In
addition,
Two
Sigma
wants
Fein
to
be
stopped
from
using
Two
Sigma’s
confidential
information
for
his
own
benefit
and
for
Fein
to
deliver
to
Two
Sigma
any
of
the
hedge
fund’s
confidential
information
or
inventions
that
he
may
possess.
Fein
has
entered
into
an
agreement
with
Two
Sigma,
agreeing
not
to
breach
his
non-disclosure
agreement
and
preserve
any
confidential
Two
Sigma
information
in
his
possession
until
an
April
16
hearing.
“Two
Sigma’s
cutting-edge
approach
to
investing
involves
analyzing
massive
volumes
of
data
to
make
investment
decisions,”
Two
Sigma
says
in
its
complaint.
“It
hires
high-caliber
mathematicians,
scientists,
and
software
engineers
from
around
the
world—such
as
Fein—to
create
mathematical
forecasting
models
and
code
them
into
software.
These
pieces
of
intellectual
property
are
highly
confidential,
classic
trade
secrets.”
Two
Sigma
declined
to
comment
on
the
lawsuit.
Efforts
to
reach
Fein
and
his
lawyer
were
unsuccessful.
Two
Sigma
has
emerged
as
a
giant
in
the
highly-secretive
and
rich
quantitative
hedge
fund
world.
The
firm
was
founded
in
2001
by
John
Overdeck
and
David
Siegel,
who
employ
sophisticated
algorithms
and
artificial
intelligence
to
trade
financial
markets.
Two
Sigma’s
$6
billion
Compass
strategy
delivered
some
of
the
best
returns
in
the
hedge
fund
industry
in
2014
before
experiencing
a
setback
in
early
2015,
when
the
strategy
lost
money.
The
firm
has
been
very
successful
in
raising
new
money
in
recent
years,
making
it
one
of
the
largest
quantitative
hedge
funds
in
the
world.
Two
Sigma
has
been
very
aggressive
in
working
to
protect
the
specific
methods
it
uses
to
trade
financial
markets.
This
is
the
third
lawsuit
it
has
filed
against
former
employees
in
an
effort
to
protect
what
Two
Sigma
has
previously
described
as
its
“lifeblood.”
As
Forbes
first
reported,
last
year

Two
Sigma
sued
Kang
Gao,
a
29-year-old
Chinese
national
who
had
worked
at
Two
Sigma
as
a
quantitative
analyst,
for
stealing
the
methods
of
trading
models.
Two
Sigma
notified
Cyrus
Vance,
the
Manhattan
District
Attorney,
who
criminally
charged
Gao.
In
February,
Gao
pleaded
guilty
to
a
single
count
of
unlawful
duplication
of
computer-related
material
and
is
currently
awaiting
sentencing.
Two
Sigma
sued
another
Chinese
national
who
used
to
work
at
the
firm,
Jianjun
Qiu,
for
allegedly
stealing
intellectual
property
and
fleeing
to
China.
That
lawsuit
was
settled
in
2007.

Fein,
who
studied
computer
science
at
Russia’s
St.
Petersburg
National
Research
University,
started
working
at
Two
Sigma
in
2007
and
resigned
in
May
2014,
when
Two
Sigma
elected
to
apply
a
one-year
non-compete
obligation.
Under
his
employment
agreement,
Fein
could
not
compete
against
Two
Sigma
for
one
year
and
in
return
he
would
be
paid
$210,000,
the
complaint
filed
by
Two
Sigma
says.
In
an
email,
Fein
said
he
intended
to
abide
by
his
non-compete
obligations,
Two
Sigma
says.
Vivek
Ramaswamy,
the
31-year-old
pharmaceutical
deal
maker
and
drug
developer,
has
done
it
again,
pulling
off
the
biggest
biotechnology
initial
public
offering
of
2016,
the
second-year
in
a
row
he
has
been
behind
a
giant
biotech
IPO.
Myovant
Sciences,
a
company
Ramaswamy
formed
in
April,
raised
$218
million
by
selling
stock
at
$15
a
piece
and
is
listing
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
on
Thursday.
The
IPO
values
Myovant
at
some
$878
million.
Earlier
this
year,
Myovant
obtained
its
only
assets,
a
prostate
cancer
drug
and
a
female
infertility
drug,
both
under
development,
from
Takeda
Pharmaceuticals.
Ramaswamy
did
not
pay
any
cash
for
the
drugs
and
instead
Myovant
issued
Takeda
5.1
million
shares,
12%
of
Myovant,
and
promised
to
pay
a
high
single-digit
royalty
on
Myovant’s
net
sales
of
both
drugs.
Ramawamy
also
managed
to
attract
Lynn
Seely
as
Myovant’s
CEO.
For
a
decade,
Seely
was
the
chief
medical
officer
of
Medivation
and
led
the
development
of
Xtandi,
a
hugely
successful
prostate
cancer
drug
with
$2
billion
in
annual
sales.
In
order
to
acquire
Xtandi,
Pfizer
in
September
bought
Medivation
for
$14
billion.
Seely
will
become
one
of
the
most
prominent
women
running
a
biotechnology
company
and
Myovant
will
be
largely
focused
on
women’s
health.
The
company’s
lead
pill,
relugolix,
is
set
to
conduct
phase
III
trials
in
women
with
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
associated
with
uterine
fibroids
and
in
women
with
endometriosis-associated
pain.
It
will
also
conduct
a
third
late-stage
trial
focusing
on
advanced
prostate
cancer.
The
other
drug
Myovant
has
acquired
is
a
female
infertility
treatment
in
early-stage
development.
Kathleen
Sebelius,
the
former
U.S.
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
has
joined
Myovant’s
board.

The
Myovant
IPO
has
caught
the
attention
of
Pfizer,
which
was
set
to
purchase
as
much
as
$30
million
of
Myovant
shares
in
the
IPO.
Ramaswamy’s
holding
company,
Roivant
Sciences,
will
own
about
64%
of
Myovant
after
the
IPO.
A
former
hedge
fund
manager,
Ramaswamy
founded
Roivant
in
2014
and
is
backed
by
hedge
funds
QVT
and
billionaire
Andreas
Halvorsen’s
Viking
Global
Investors.
Last
year,
Ramaswamy
was
behind
the
biggest
U.S.
biotech
IPO
ever
when
Roivant’s
Axovant
Sciences
raised
$360
million.
Like
Myovant,
Axovant
was
a
very
young
company
that
had
only
recently
purchased
its
only
asset,
an
experimental
Alzheimer’s
pill
from
GlaxoSmithKline.
In
that
case,
Axovant
had
purchased
the
drug
for
$5
million
and
a
12.5%
royalty
based
on
net
sales.
Axovant’s
stock
nearly
doubled
after
its
debut
and
the
company
was
valued
at
nearly
$3
billion.
The
state
of
Rhode
Island
voted
on
Wednesday
to
exit
seven
hedge
funds,
including
Och-Ziff
Capital
Management,
which
last
month
agreed
to
pay
a
$400
million
fine
to
settle
foreign
bribery
charges.
The
state's
Investment
Commission,
which
directs
how
its
$7.7
billion
pension
fund
is
invested,
asked
for
$585
million
back
from
funds
whose
performance
had
been
uneven,
a
spokesman
said.
Och-Ziff
has
been
asked
to
return
$103
million
while
Samlyn
Capital
will
return
$106
million.
The
state
also
asked
for
all
of
its
money
back
from
Partner
Fund
Management,
Emerging
Sovereign
Group,
which
used
to
have
a
partnership
with
Carlyle
Group,
Brigade
Capital
Management,
Brevan
Howard
Asset
Management
and
Ascend
Capital.
Viking
Global
Investors
was
asked
to
return
$51
million,
or
half
of
the
money
it
manages
for
the
state.
In
September,
the
state
decided
to
cut
its
allocation
to
hedge
funds
to
6.5
percent
from
15
percent.
State
Treasurer
Seth
Magaziner
said
the
move
was
part
of
his
"Back
to
Basics"
plan
where
the
state
expects
to
invest
some
of
the
money
being
returned
by
hedge
funds
in
more
traditional
assets.
Rhode
Island
joins
a
growing
list
of
state
pension
funds,
including
New
Jersey
and
New
York,
currently
cooling
on
hedge
funds
as
they
have
underperformed
but
charged
high
fees.
Investors
have
pulled
$29.2
billion
out
of
global
hedge
funds
during
the
third
quarter,
putting
2016
on
track
for
the
first
annual
outflows
since
the
financial
crisis,
research
firm
eVestment
said
on
Wednesday.
Och-Ziff
has
been
managing
money
for
the
state
since
2011
and
has
returned
6.73
percent
since
then.
While
it
was
once
a
favorite
with
large
pension
funds,
it
has
seen
redemptions
tick
up,
shrinking
assets
to
$37
billion
now
from
$44
billion
at
the
start
of
the
year.
A
spokesman
for
the
hedge
fund
declined
to
comment.
Rhode
Island
is
not
abandoning
all
hedge
funds.

A
bigger
bet
on
European
stocks
in
the
last
quarter
helped
U.S.
hedge
fund
Viking
Global
Investors
improve
returns
after
a
difficult
start
to
the
year.
"Notably,
both
net
and
gross
exposure
to
European
companies
increased
by
11
percentage
points
as
we
added
longs
in
several
sectors,"
the
hedge
fund
told
investors
in
a
quarterly
letter
dated
Oct.
14
and
seen
by
Reuters
on
Monday.
Viking's
flagship
Viking
Global
Equities
fund
is
now
roughly
flat
for
the
year,
trailing
the
HFRI
Composite
Index'
4.15
percent
gain.
During
the
third
quarter,
Viking's
5.7
percent
gain
helped
wipe
away
much
of
the
first
quarter's
8.3
percent
drop.
Andreas
Halvorsen,
Viking's
founder,
said
European
stocks
are
still
more
attractively
priced
than
stocks
in
other
regions.
"This
increase
does
not
represent
a
top-down
macro
bet
on
the
European
economy
but
reflects
strong
idea
flow
from
our
analysts
covering
European
stocks
and
a
general
observation
that
valuations
are
relatively
attractive
in
that
region
compared
with
other
parts
of
the
world."
Viking
listed
only
one
European
stock
-
English-Swedish
pharmaceutical
company
AstraZeneca
-
among
its
top
10
investments.
Amazon.com
remains
Viking's
single
largest
bet,
followed
by
Alphabet
Inc
and
Facebook.
Amazon
also
ranked
as
the
fund's
best
performer,
contributing
1.2
percentage
points
to
gains.
Canadian
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
company
Encana
also
performed
well.
Viking
said
it
built
a
large
position
early
in
the
year
when
oil
and
gas
prices
fell
and
says
the
stock
has
room
to
rise

With
$33
billion
in
assets,
Viking
has
long
been
counted
as
one
of
the
industry's
biggest
and
most
successful
hedge
funds,
lining
up
institutional
investors
such
as
pension
funds.
But
recent
performance
has
hurt
the
firm
some.
Last
week

of

Island
asked
the
firm
to
return
$51
million,
half
of
the
money
it
manages
for

Just
when
you
thought
a
turn
in
stock
markets,
or
Google&#039;s
GOOGL
-2.83%
name
change
to
Alphabet
might
spell
the
end
of
FANG,
it
still
lives!
Billionaire
hedge
fund
manager
Andreas
Halvorsen
disclosed
on
Monday
his
fund
Viking
Global
purchased
over
20
million
Facebook
FB
-2.44%
shares
in
the
first
quarter,
worth
in
nearly
$2.4
billion
at
current
prices.
The
purchase
completes
Viking
Global’s
FANG
trade.
The
top-performing
hedge
fund
also
3.4
million
Amazon
shares
worth
in
excess
of
$2.4
billion,
two
million
Google
(Alphabet)
shares
worth
roughly
$1.5
billion,
and
eight
million
Netflix
NFLX
-5.24%
shares
worth
over
$718
million.
FANG,
of
course,
is
an
acronym
that
captures
four
of
the
S&P
500
Index’s
top
performers,
Facebook,
Amazon.com
AMZN
-3.75%,
Netflix
and
Google
(Alphabet).
Many
stock
market
commentators
argue
FANG
stocks
(FANA
for
sticklers)
have
carried
the
gains
of
the
S&P
500
Index
in
recent
years.
For
instance,
Jefferies
equity
strategist
Sean
Darby
said
in
November
he
believed
skittish
investors
were
piling
out
of
the
broader
market
and
into
growth-oriented
FANG
stocks,
lowering
overall
equity
market
breadth.
“Modest
U.S.
economic
growth
and
peak
margins
should
put
a
premium
on
stocks
with
perceived
high
secular
growth
prospects,”
added
Goldman
Sachs
strategist
David
Kostin
in
mid-November.
Respected
investors
such
as
billionaire
Stanley
Druckenmiller
also
are
giving
support
to
the
FANG
trade.
Last
fall,
Druckenmiller
gave
an
overwhelmingly
bearish
read
on
U.S.
corporations
and
equity
markets
at
the
New
York
Times
Dealbook
Conference.
However,
he
counter-intuitively
told
an
audience
he
was
buying
shares
in
Facebook
and
Amazon
because
they
are
reinvesting
in
their
businesses
at
a
time
of
muted
growth,
instead
of
favoring
returns
of
capital.



It
seems
Druckenmiller
isn’t
alone
here.
In
total,
Halvorsen
of
Viking
Global
has
over
$6.3
billion
invested
in
FANG
stocks,
roughly
a
quarter
of
the
hedge
fund’s
over
$27
billion
equity
portfolio.
Last
year,
Halvorsen’s
flagship
fund
gained
8.3%
net
of
fees,
far
surpassing
gains
on
the
S&P
500
Index
and
the
HFR
Hedge
Fund
Index,
bolstered
by
large
investments
in
the
technology
and
pharmaceutical
sectors.
Viking
Global’s
first
quarter
holdings
don’t
just
indicate
a
completion
of
a
FANG
investment.
They
also
indicate
Halvorsen
has
reconfigured
Viking’s
pharma
sector
bets.
The
fund
disclosed
it
sold
all
of
its
shares
in
embattled
Valeant
Pharmaceuticals
VRX
+4.41%
and
drug
distributor
McKesson
MCK
+2.46%.
The
same
filing,
however,
showed
Viking
making
new
investments
in
Lilly
and
DaVita
DVA
+1.15%.
The
fund
also
bolstered
bets
on
oil
and
gas
drillers
Cabot,
Encana
and
Gulfport,
while
trimming
its
stake
in
Pioneer
Natural
Resources
PXD
+1.94%.
Our
data
culled
from
the
659
funds
in
our
database
which
filed
13Fs
for
the
June
quarter,
and
whose
portfolios
contained
at
least
5
long
positions
in
companies
valued
at
$1
billion,
revealed
some
startling
statistics.
Foremost
was
the
fact
that
an
impressive
95%
of
them
delivered
positive
stock
returns
with
those
long
positions
during
the
third
quarter
based
on
our
methodology.
In
comparison,
S&P
500
ETFs
returned
just
3.3%
during
the
quarter,
so
that
high
a
percentage
of
funds
posting
gains
is
a
noteworthy
feat.
However,
what
we
don’t
see
in
13F
filings
are
hedge
funds’
holdings
that
don’t
necessarily
do
as
well:
the
short-side
of
their
portfolios,
as
well
as
their
low-yield
debt
positions.
Couple
that
with
demanding
fees,
and
you
can
see
why
hedge
funds
consistently
underperform
the
market
net
of
fees,
despite
being
quality
stock
pickers.
That’s
why
at
Insider
Monkey,
we
analyze
only
the
top
stock
picks
of
the
top
hedge
funds,
to
cut
through
the
fees
and
underperformance.
In
this
article,
we’ll
take
a
look
at
the
performance
of
Tiger
Global
Management
and
four
of
its
favorite
stocks.
Founded
by
Chase
Coleman
in
2001,
Tiger
Global
manages
a
public
equity
portfolio
valued
at
$5.06
billion
at
the
end
of
June,
down
from
$6.93
billion
a
quarter
earlier.
The
fund
invests
almost
primarily
in
consumer
stocks,
which
accounted
for
81%
of
the
value
of
its
public
equity
portfolio’s
holdings
on
June
30.
Those
stocks
(and
the
fund’s
others)
enjoyed
a
strong
Q3
according
to
our
calculations,
which
show
that
its
17
positions
in
companies
valued
at
$1
billion
or
more
on
June
30
delivered
weighted
average
returns
of
19.4%
during
the
third
quarter,
ranking
it
as
the
top
Tiger
fund
and
pushing
its
year-to-date
gains
into
positive
territory
after
a
tough
first-half.
It
should
be
noted
that
our
calculations
may
be
different
from
the
fund’s
actual
returns,
as
they
do
not
factor
in
changes
to
positions
during
the
quarter,
or
positions
that
don’t
get
reported
on
Form
13Fs,
like
short
positions.
Now
then,
let’s
take
a
look
at
Tiger
Global’s
top
picks
on
June
30
and
see
how
they
performed
in
the
third-quarter.
First
up
is
Amazon.com,
Inc.
(NASDAQ:AMZN),
the
fund’s
top
pick
at
the
end
of
June.
Tiger
Global
owned
a
$1.05
billion
position
in
the
stock
at
that
time,
consisting
of
1.46
million
shares,
up
by
41%
since
the
end
of
March.
Amazon
posted
a
big
quarter,
gaining
17%,
though
shares
have
slumped
in
the
fourth-quarter
following
lighter-than-expected
earnings.
Amazon’s
Twitch
game
streaming
service
is
preparing
to
roll
out
ad-block
busting
technology
that
the
company
believes
will
make
it
much
harder
for
viewers
to
bypass
video
ads.
At
Q2’s
end,
a
total
of
145
of
the
hedge
funds
tracked
by
Insider
Monkey
were
long
this
stock,
a
9%
rise
from
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
2016,
and
pushing
it
to
its
highest
ever
level
in
terms
of
hedge
fund
ownership
among
the
funds
in
our
database.
The
largest
stake
in
Amazon.com,
Inc.
(NASDAQ:AMZN)
was
held
by
Viking
Global,
which
reported
holding
$2.35
billion
worth
of
stock
as
of
the
end
of
June.
It
was
followed
by
Fisher
Asset
Management
with
a
$1.50
billion
position.
Other
investors
bullish
on
the
company
included
Lansdowne
Partners,
Eagle
Capital
Management,
and
Lone
Pine
Capital.
At
the
end
of
the
second
quarter,
a
total
of
134
of
the
hedge
funds
tracked
by
Insider
Monkey
were
bullish
on
this
stock,
a
37%
jump
from
one
quarter
earlier.
When
looking
at
the
institutional
investors
followed
by
Insider
Monkey,
Berkshire
Hathaway,
managed
by
Warren
Buffett,
holds
the
most
valuable
position
in
Charter
Communications,
Inc.
(NASDAQ:CHTR)
($2.13
billion
position).
The
second-most
bullish
fund
manager
is
Lone
Pine
Capital,
managed
by
Stephen
Mandel
($1.10
billion
position).
Remaining
peers
that
are
bullish
encompass
Eric
W.
Mandelblatt’s
Soroban
Capital
Partners
and
John
Armitage’s
Egerton
Capital
Limited.
Tiger
Global
owned
750,000
shares
of
Priceline.com
Inc
(NASDAQ:PCLN)
on
June
30,
valued
at
$936.31
million
and
ranking
it
as
the
third-most
valuable
stock
holding
of
the
fund,
and
it
grew
more
valuable
during
Q3,
as
shares
surged
by
18%
to
nearly
$1,500.
In
its
second-quarter
investor
letter,
Tiger
Global
said
that
Priceline
“benefits
from
low
supplier
concentration
given
the
extremely
fragmented
hotel
market
globally
and
its
relationships
with
over
800,000
hotels,
vacation
homes
and
urban
residences.”
Heading
into
the
third
quarter
of
2016,
a
total
of
85
of
the
hedge
funds
tracked
by
Insider
Monkey
were
long
Priceline,
a
2%
dip
from
the
end
of
the
March
quarter.
The
largest
stake
in
Priceline.com
Inc
(NASDAQ:PCLN)
was
held
by
Lone
Pine
Capital,
managed
by
a
fellow
Tiger
Cub
Stephen
Mandel,
which
reported
holding
$1.39
billion
worth
of
Priceline
shares
as
of
the
end
of
June.
Other
investors
bullish
on
the
company
included
Citadel
Investment
Group,
Maverick
Capital,
and
Egerton
Capital
Limited.
Finally,
Tiger
Global
owned
44
million
ADRs
of
JD.Com
Inc
(ADR)
(NASDAQ:JD)
at
the
end
of
the
second
quarter,
unchanged
during
the
period.
Other
hedge
funds
were
growing
more
bearish
on
the
company
and
China
in
general
during
that
time,
as
a
total
of
51
of
the
hedge
funds
tracked
by
Insider
Monkey
held
long
positions
in
JD.Com
on
June
30,
a
30%
slide
from
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
2016.
JD.Com
rebounded
from
being
near
its
52-week-lows
at
the
end
of
June
to
post
greater
than
20%
gains
during
the
third-quarter.
According
to
Insider
Monkey’s
hedge
fund
database,
Hillhouse
Capital
Management,
managed
by
Lei
Zhang,
holds
the
most
valuable
position
in
JD.Com
Inc
(ADR)
(NASDAQ:JD).

billion
position
in
the
stock,

of
its

to
write
off
Rs
3500

has
so
far
raised
about
$1.2
billion
from
a
clutch
of
investors
including
Tiger
Global
Management,
Matrix
Partners,
SoftBank
Group
and
Didi
Chuxing.Last
year,
Snapdeal.com
raised
$500
million
from
Chinese
e-commerce
firm
Alibaba
Group,
Foxconn
Technology
Group
and
existing
investor
SoftBank
Group,
which
then
valued
the
Delhi-based
firm
at
about
$4.8
billion
post
money.
SoftBank
has
so
far
invested
close
to
$2
billion
in
India
and
earlier
this
year
it
stated
that
it
is
looking
to
scale
up
the
investment
to
$10
billion
in
next
5-10
years.Last
month,
it
said
it
will
form
a
new
fund
with
Saudi
Arabia’s
public
investment
fund
to
invest
as
much
as
$100
billion
in
the
global
technology
industry
in
the
next
five
years.For
the
July-September
quarter,
SoftBank
posted
a
net
profit
of
512
billion

Bengaluru:
India’s
largest
ride-hailing
start-up,
Ola,
is
in
talks
to
raise
about
$600
million
and
may
close
the
deal
by
year
end,
as
it
seeks
to
counter
an
increasingly
aggressive
Uber
Technologies
Inc.
in
the
coveted
India
market,
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter.
The
funds
are
coming
from
new
and
existing
investors
and
would
give
six-year
old
Ola
enough
capital
for
at
least
18
months,
said
the
person,
asking
not
to
be
named
because
the
talks
are
private.
Negotiations
are
ongoing
and
the
amount
raised
or
timing
may
still
change.
SoftBank
Group
Corp.,
a
current
investor,
plans
to
participate
and
may
lead
the
funding
round,
the
person
said.
The
fundraising
would
be
a
record
for
India
this
year
and
intensify
the
fight
between
ANI
Technologies
Pvt
Ltd’s
Ola,
last
valued
at
$5
billion,
and
Uber,
the
world’s
best-funded
technology
start-up
with
a
valuation
of
$69
billion.
Ola,
backed
by
SoftBank
and
Tiger
Global
Management,
could
use
the
funds
to
speed
up
its
spending
on
recruiting
drivers
and
helping
them
lease
vehicles.
It
would
also
allow
Ola
to
expand
geographically
as
it
tries
to
maintain
its
lead
over
Uber,
which
has
increased
investments
in
India
after
agreeing
to
sell
its
money-losing
China
operation.
“Funding
is
critical
for
Ola
to
keep
its
momentum
and
maintain
its
market
leadership
in
the
$10
billion
ride-hailing
market
which
is
readying
for
its
next
phase
of
expansion,”
said
Jaspal
Singh,
a
partner
at
Delhi-based
transportation
consultancy,
Valoriser
Consultants.
“Uber
has
even
deeper
pockets
now
that
it
is
out
of
China,
which
was
a
big
drain
on
its
resources,
and
it
will
now
focus
on
India
in
a
big
way,”
he
said.
The
funding
round
come
during
a
long
dry
spell
in
the
world’s
third-largest
start-up
market.
India’s
technology
start-ups
raised
$4.23
billion
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
this
year,
less
than
half
the
total
for
the
same
period
of
2015,
according
to
researcher
Preqin.
Ola’s
other
investors
include
DST
Global,
Accel
Partners
and
Sequoia
Capital.
Dilapidated
public
transport
infrastructure
in
Indian
cities
and
the
lack
of
convenient
transport
options
has
helped
on-demand
ride-summoning
start-up
Ola
and
its
San
Francisco-based
competitor
to
expand
at
a
rapid
pace.
They
are
now
vying
with
each
other
to
woo
customers
like
government
departments
and
train
passengers,
as
well
as
make
it
easier
to
bring
new
drivers
on
to
their
platforms.
For
instance,
Ola
and
Uber
have
tied
up
with
automakers
like
BMW,
Tata
Motors
and
Maruti
Suzuki
to
lease
cars
with
attractive
and
affordable
financing
options.
As
smartphone
usage
soars
in
India,
both
are
burning
cash
to
attract
drivers
and
riders
with
incentives—making
funding
a
key
component
in
the
battle.
Ola’s
founder
and
CEO
Bhavish
Aggarwal
said
in
an
interview
this
summer
that
Ola
with
a
million
rides
daily
is
ahead
of
its
competitor
and
is
rolling
out
innovations
at
a
rapid
clip.
It
recently
allowed
customers
to
book
Ola
rides
offline,
a
boon
in
a
country
with
poor
wi-fi
connectivity
and
expensive
data
plans.
Aggarwal
did
not
respond
to
an
email
about
the
upcoming
funding
round.
A
spokeswoman
for
SoftBank
responded
saying
they
are
“unable
to
comment
on
speculation
on
fund-raising
efforts.”
